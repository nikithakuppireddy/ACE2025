    <p>The flooring sets the foundation for any interior space. For hall interior design, opt for wider planks of hardwood floors or natural stone materials like marble, travertine, or slate tiles to give underfoot a luxurious and welcoming feel.</p>

    <p>The kitchen layout is the shape of your kitchen. There are six basic types of kitchen layouts: G-shaped, L-shaped, straight, parallel, U-shaped and island kitchen. This is created with the order of the kitchen countertop, essential appliances and storage spaces.</p>

    <p>Bedroom furniture designs bring in elements of comfort and fullness to space. If your bedroom has ample space, then put a few accent pieces. You can place a work table in a corner and a vintage trunk at the base of the bed to amp up the aesthetics. This can also double up as storage for bed linen.</p>
